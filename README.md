# Compiling: 
In order to compile pro.py, you mujst go in your respective RPI and you must do the following

# python3 pro.py

The file was different within the video, so I used a different name but the file I upploaded on github is pro.py
In order to compile the server.py or the server of the program, then you must do the following

# python3 server.py

Remember, this must be done on your computer locally in the terminal, not the RPI.
